# Welcome to my personal Github page!

## A bit about me:
- Trained as a clinician in India, practiced for a bit following graduation from medical school, mostly as a general physician.
- MPH in Epidemiology from UMass Amherst.
- Currently, biostatistician at the Environmental Medicine and Public Health Division of the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY.
- Work with [Dr. Nicholas DeFelice](https://www.mountsinai.org/profiles/nicolas-defelice)

I work on a project whose final goal is to forecast outbreaks of West Nile Virus infections in humans, by modeling the positivity rate of West Nile Virus infection in mosquito vector populations in Suffolk County, NY. Since climatological conditions often predict positivty in mosquito populations, we are also aiming to take these conditions like atmospheric temperature, soil moisture, rainfall and humidity into account while predicting outbreaks of WNV in mosquito populations, which might foreshadow a spillover infection in humans.

## Motivation for taking the CyVerse FOSS 2020 course:
My motivation for joining this course is the challenges I faced as part of my work in this project. I have no experience working with datasets of the magnitude of a few terabytes of remote sensing data in real time, and have struggled to develop and maintain workflows to process such data. My workflows initially were clumsy, did not take advantage of the processing power our lab offered and were too inflexible to allow portability to parallel projects. I had no experience with version control systems, so my work was often isolated, and could not benefit from work done previously or be integrated into my colleagues' work. 

## What do I hope to take away from this course?
My goal at the end of the course is to be confident about these aspects of reproducible science. Specifically, I want to be comfortable with handling large datasets, figuring out how to build workflows that avoid bottlenecks, and learn skills that help in collaborating with my teammates better. I recognize that these skills are an essential part of reproducible science, and am committed to developing these routines in my professional career.
